## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you proceed with setting up the iCare - E-Health Management System, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** iCare is built using Java, so you'll need JDK installed. You can download and install the latest version of JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- **Eclipse IDE:** Although not mandatory, Eclipse provides a robust development environment for Java projects and can greatly enhance your development experience. You can download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).

- **MySQL Database:** iCare uses MySQL as the backend database to store medical records and appointment information. You'll need to have MySQL Server installed on your system. Download the MySQL installer for your platform from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

- **JDBC Driver:** JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) enables Java applications to interact with the MySQL database. Since MySQL Connector/J is the official JDBC driver for MySQL, you'll need to download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/). Make sure to add the JDBC driver to your project's classpath.
